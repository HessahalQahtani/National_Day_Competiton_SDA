## **Project: Saudi Arabia Ranks Dashboard**
1. **Introduction**
    - Project Overview:  
The dashboard shows Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Ranks in different categories (ex: economic, oil production...
etc.) on a specific period (2016-2022). The reason behind starting the data in 2016 is the
announcement of Saudi Vision 2030. However, the data ends in 2022 since the ranks around the
world announce at the end of the year. Therefore, we will focus on showing the improvement.
