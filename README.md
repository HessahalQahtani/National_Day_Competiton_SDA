## **Project: Saudi Arabia Ranks Dashboard**
1. **Introduction**
    - Project Overview:  
The dashboard shows Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Ranks in different categories (Economic, Oil production, Unemployment rate) on a specific period (2016-2022).
The reason behind starting the data in 2016 is the announcement of Saudi Vision 2030. However, the data ends in 2022 since the ranks around the
world announce at the end of the year. Therefore, we will focus on showing the improvement.

2. **Project Steps**
   - Collect the necessary data from various sources.
   - Translate the data to Arabic by a function in python.
   - Ensure data accuracy, consistency, and quality.
   - EDA is employed to gain insights into the data for comparing Saudi Arabia at both global and Arab levels.
   - Choose the appropriate visualization types (ex: line chart track changes in the specific time we had chosen.)
   - Design the dashboard layout to reflect the identity of National Day 93.
   - Publish the Dashboard to the Power BI Service then to the web ([The link will be available only until the end of October 2023](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmU4NTU5MWItMjkzNy00NzMzLTg2MzQtNDk3NWRkY2UwZWM2IiwidCI6ImRkZjgzYjUwLWY0OTEtNDNmZS1hNmJlLWZmZDc3YTU2MjBmMSIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection673b2391eb771bd9f28b))
